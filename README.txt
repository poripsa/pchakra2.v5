This file needs python installed to be run.

Programming Lamguage used: Python version 2.7

The program is designed is the following way:
1) A for loop loops through the number of iterations desired.
2) Each iteration generates a random node in C-Free
3) A new node is added if it falls with a certain step size
4) The data structure for the node is a simple two dimentional tuple.
5) The parent of each node is saved in a dictionary.
6) This dictionary is referenced to compute the cost of each edge.
7) The final output of the program is a simulation which shows all the edges of the tree in black, the final path from start(green) to goal(red) in pink.
8) The project report should be opened from the folder where in the images(included in this folder) is stored.
9) Double clicking on the project report html file (Project Report.html) should open the webpage in default browser. 
   Otherwise right clicking the html file>open with>(choose browser) should open the file as well.

This program can be run from any IDE (integrated development environment) which supports python such as pycharm.
Also python libraries pygame and math are required for thr program to run.
